# Movie Recommendation System

The movie recommendation system provides personalized recommendation to each user based on 2 aspects:
1. Content Based Filtering
2. Collaborative Based Filtering

### Content Based Filtering:
Content Based Filtering is based on the user data by providing ratings on the movies. Based on this, the user profile is generated and recommendations are given.

### Collaborative Filtering:
Collaborative filtering is based on previous behaviour of the user and not based on present context. Users are grouped together and recommendations are shown based on similar likability.

a) User-User Collaborative filtering:
It is based on segmenting users on the similarity matrix. Users with similar tastes are grouped together. 

b) Item-Item Collaborative filtering: It is based on segmenting movies(here) on the similarity matrix. 

### Implementation:
### GraphLabs:

It is a graph-based, high performance, distributed computation framework written in C++ which is used for Machine Learning in Python.
