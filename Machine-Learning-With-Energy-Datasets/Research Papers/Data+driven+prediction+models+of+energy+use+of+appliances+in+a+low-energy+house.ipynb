    "#### 1.1 - Appliances and their load:\n",
    "\n",
    "The different appliances used in a house would be television,PC, laptop, TV, refrigerator, cooking stove,laundry, dishwasher, lights and other small appliances. Of these, refrigerator has a very uniform load profile. However, laptops, cooking stove, dishwasher, lights and other appliances have very user dependent usage and differs from house to house.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 - Electricity load prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=red>Energy consumption by appliances accounts for about 30% of the total electricity demands from the residential sector.</font> Hence, it is very important to understand the appliances energy consumption and try to reduce the energy demand.Prediction of electricity consumption can be done by the past consumption per hour, day or even month. However, the <font color= red> last 24 hr is presumed to be the most prominent in terms of electricity prediction.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically studies have used models such as multiple regression,neural networks, forecasting methods, engineering methods,support vector machines, time series techniques and forecasting methods to predict the electricity demand. The models usually have considered parameters such as the time of day, outdoor temperature, month, weekend, holidays, yesterday’s consumption, rainfall index, global solar radiation, wind speed and occupancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "An extensive list of variables was studied in recent study: weather,location (ZIP code), age of building, ownership, presence of double pane windows, energy efficientlight fixtures, floor area, pet ownership,number of refrigerators and entertainment devices, number of occupants and income level. It concluded that the most important variables are weather, location and floor plan.\n",
    "Among the appliances, the most important ones in terms of electricity consumption is the refrigerator and entertainment appliances (TV, video games, airconditioner, heater etc.). It also states that the high usage of appliances results in low appliance efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color= blue>How appliances affect energy consumption:</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased no. of appliances results in more energy consumption\n",
    "- Some appliances like heater, air conditioner contribute significantly while some others like lights, charger etc contribute less\n",

    "- Pattern of energy use by appliance - refrigerator has nearly flat consumption rate while laundry(washer and dryer) has varying energy consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weather parameters like too hot or too cold will affect the use of heaters and air conditioner which affect the energy consumption significantly\n",
    "\n",
    "- For highly insulated buildings, the thermal influence of appliances on internal gains become more important and relevant in building energy performance\n"
